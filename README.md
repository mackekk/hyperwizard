# HyperWizard –  Canvas Platformer

A neon, psychedelic platformer where a wizard sprints through hyperspace. Built for speed, clarity, and minimal config.

## Project Goal
- Ship a smooth, arcade-style platformer with tight feel (run + higher/longer jump).
- Keep the codebase small and hackable (single React/TS canvas component to start).
- Add visuals/features incrementally without breaking initialization/perf.

## Tech Stack
- **Runtime:** Node.js **22.14.0** (managed by **nvm-windows**)
- **Package manager:** npm 10
- **Frontend:** React 18 + **TypeScript**
- **Dev/build:** **Vite**
- **Rendering:** HTML5 Canvas (no game engine)

## Requirements
- Windows with nvm-windows ≥ 1.2.x
- Node 22.14.0 installed via nvm:
  ```bash
  nvm install 22.14.0
  nvm use 22.14.0
